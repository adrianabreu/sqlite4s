/**
  * SQLiteJob is a unit of work accepted by {@link SQLiteQueue}. You can
  * implement {@link #job} method and add the job to the queue with {@link SQLiteQueue#execute} method.
  * <p/>
  * A job can optionally have a result. Type parameter <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> defines the type of the result, and the
  * value of the result is returned by the <code>job()</code> method. If job finishes unsuccessfully or is cancelled,
  * the result is always null. If you don't need the job to have a result, define it as
  * <code>SQLiteJob&lt;Object&gt;</code> or <code>SQLiteJob&lt;Void&gt;</code> and return null from the <code>job()</code>
  * method.
  * <p/>
  * Job implements {@link Future} interface and can be used along with different types of future results.
  * <p/>
  * Also, you can override methods {@link #jobStarted}, {@link #jobFinished}, {@link #jobCancelled} and
  * {@link #jobError} to implement callbacks during the job's lifecycle.
  * <p/>
  * SQLiteJob is a one-time object. Once the job is finished, it cannot be executed again.
  * <p/>
  * Public methods of SQLiteJob are thread-safe unless specified otherwise. Protected methods are mostly called
  * from the database thread and must be overridden carefully.
  * <p/>
  * When programming a job, it's a good practice to keep transaction boundaries within single job. That is, if you
  * BEGIN TRANSACTION in the job, make sure you COMMIT or ROLLBACK in the end. Otherwise, your transaction will
  * remain unfinished, locks held, and you possible wouldn't know which job will execute next in the context of
  * this unfinished transaction.
  *
  * @tparam T type of the result
  * @see SQLiteQueue
