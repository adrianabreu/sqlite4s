/**
  * SQLiteQueue is a basic implementation of job queue for an SQLite connection. It provides multi-threaded
  * or GUI application with asynchronous execution of database tasks in a single separate thread with a single
  * {@link SQLiteConnection}.
  * <p/>
  * The queue is started and stopped using {@link #start} and {@link #stop} methods correspondingly.
  * Each database task is represented by a subclass of {@link SQLiteJob}. A task is scheduled for execution
  * by {@link #execute} method. Tasks are served on first-come, first-serve basis.
  * <p/>
  * Public methods of SQLiteQueue are <strong>thread-safe</strong>, unless noted otherwise.
  * </p>
  * When writing tasks, it's a good practice to keep transaction boundaries within single task. That is, if you
  * BEGIN TRANSACTION in the task, make sure you COMMIT or ROLLBACK in the end. Otherwise, your transaction will
  * remain unfinished, locks held, and you possible wouldn't know which job will execute next in the context of
  * this unfinished transaction.
  * <p/>
  * SQLiteQueue may be subclassed in order to change certain behavior. If you need some things to be done
  * differently, look for a protected method to override. For example, you can implement a priority queue
  * instead of FIFO queue.
  * <p/>
  * SQLiteQueue and SQLiteJob are written to handle exceptions and errors in a controlled way. In particular,
  * if the queue thread terminates abnormally, SQLiteQueue will try to "reincarnate" by starting another thread
  * and opening another connection to the database. All queued tasks (except for the one that caused the problem)
  * should survive the reincarnation and execute in the new thread.
  * <p/>
  * Reincarnation is not possible for in-memory database, since the database is lost after connection closes.
  * <p/>
  * Some examples:
  * <pre>
  * void start() {
  * myQueue = new SQLiteQueue(myDatabaseFile);
  *   myQueue.start();
  * }
  * <p/>
  * int getTableRowCount(final String tableName) {
  * return myQueue.execute(new SQLiteJob&lt;Integer&gt;() {
  * protected Integer job(SQLiteConnection connection) throws SQLiteException {
  * SQLiteStatement st = connection.prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM " + tableName);
  * try {
  *         st.step();
  * return st.columnInt(0);
  * } finally {
  *         st.dispose();
  * }
  * }
  * }).complete();
  * }
  * </pre>
